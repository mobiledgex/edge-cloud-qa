A sub-package for efficiently dealing with polynomials.

Within the documentation for this sub-package, a "finite power series,"
i.e., a polynomial (also referred to simply as a "series") is represented
by a 1-D numpy array of the polynomial's coefficients, ordered from lowest
order term to highest.  For example, array([1,2,3]) represents
``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``, where P_n is the n-th order basis polynomial
applicable to the specific module in question, e.g., `polynomial` (which
"wraps" the "standard" basis) or `chebyshev`.  For optimal performance,
all operations on polynomials, including evaluation at an argument, are
implemented as operations on the coefficients.  Additional (module-specific)
information can be found in the docstring for the module of interest.
