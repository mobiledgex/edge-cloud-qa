A replacement wrapper around the subprocess module, which provides a stub
implementation of subprocess members on Google App Engine
(which are missing in subprocess).

Instead of importing subprocess, other modules should use this as follows:

from matplotlib.compat import subprocess

This module is safe to import from anywhere within matplotlib.
